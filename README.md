# 🍽️ SnackStack - My Food Tracker App

This was a fun little project I built while learning JavaScript and the DOM. It lets you track your favorite foods, filter them by category (like Healthy or Junk), and even shows a fun food fact when you add something. I added some colors and emojis to make it more playful.
